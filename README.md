# Plate My Week

[Plate My Week](https://plate.bscox.com) is a recipe website capable of importing recipes from external sites. It does this by parsing SEO tags contained on a supplied link, similarly to how Google and other search engines do. It will then rephrase the recipe using ChatGPT in order to reformat the recipes in a way that's easier for me to read and understand.

## Usage
To use Plate My Week, simply navigate to the website (linked above). You can click around and look at a few of the imported recipes. If you create an account, you can also create your own recipes. Note that only certain accounts have permissions to import recipes from external sites in order to avoid costly ChatGPT bills.
